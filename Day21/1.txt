Cycle in LinkedList:

-- A cycle (loop) in a linked list occurs when a node's next pointer points back to a previous node instead of NULL or next node.

-- This creates an infinite loop because traversal will never reach NULL.

-- If a cycle exists, the concept of a single tail breaks down.

-- We can't say tail->next = NULL directly, because we don't know where the cycle starts and which node to call "tail."
