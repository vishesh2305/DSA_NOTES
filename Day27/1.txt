Stack Data structure:

-- A Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.

-- The element inserted last is removed first.

Use cases:

1. We can use stack to implement undo feature.

2. To build navigation (forward/backword)

3. Build compilers (ex :- syntax checking)

4. Evaluate mathmatic expression (ex :- 1+2*3)

5. Function Call Stack (used in recursion & program execution)

Example:

-- Stacks of plates (we can only view or remove the top plate).
-- If we want to get bottom plate then we need to remove all plates one by
by one. (LIFO)





Implementation:

Internally, we can implement Stack in C++ using:

1. Arrays/vector

2. Linked List

It's basically a wrapper around arrays/LL with special access rules.

3. STL stack (wrapper around deque/vector/list)
