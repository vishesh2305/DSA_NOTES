Defination:

-- Searching is the process of finding the position (index) of a particular element (called the target) in a given
array or list.

Types of Searching:

-- We can search for an element in an array using 3 common techniques:

1. Linear Search

2. Binary Search (Only for sorted arrays)

3. Hashing-based Search (Using hash tables/maps)






2. Binary Search

Logic:

-- Binary Search is used on sorted arrays (ascending or descending).
-- It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.
-- the time complexity of the binary search will be less than 0(n) ?

Note: the binary search algorithm is based on divide and conquer strategy.
